# Text - Mining - Final Project - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) - (PDF-Bot with LLMs)
![Langchain](https://github.com/VenkataTarunKumarMavillapalli/Text-Mining-Streamlit/assets/121502018/4b4b57ee-04d4-4619-a1b5-2856cd4fba5a)


Our Streamlit application allows users to interact with PDF documents using
conversational artificial intelligence (AI). Users can upload PDF files, ask
questions related to the content of these documents, and receive responses
generated by a pre-trained AI model. Tried to implement Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which is an AI framework.

Features:

• PDF File Upload: Users can upload one or more PDF files containing text
content.

• AI Model Selection: Users can select from a variety of pre-trained AI
models to generate responses to their questions.

• User Question Input: Users can input questions related to the content of
the uploaded PDF files.

• Temperature Adjustment: Users can adjust the temperature parameter for
response generation, controlling the creativity and randomness of the AI-
generated responses.

• Response Display: The application displays the generated response,
broken down into paragraphs.

• Chat Memory: Users can view a history of their interactions, including
questions asked and AI-generated responses.
